  Residency Program Director (PD), Associate Program Director (APD), Residency Research Lead (RL) and Simulation Director (SD): We allocated 16% of the Program Director's and  8%  of our residency faculty team's  (APD, RL, SD, except a flat rate for OB sim lead) salary and benefits to the CalMed grant.  For the faculty salary support was provided for GME/residency activities only.  Sixteen percent for the program director includes time to support the 2 additional trainees, organize the expansion and improvement of the curriculum (including EDI, Community Outreach and other components of the residnet leadership curriculum).  For three faculty eight percent of the costs represent those incurred by teaching and supporting the two (of twenty-four total) residents that are supported by the CalMed grant.   We expended our simulation curriculum and added support via a flat fee for the new faculty member.","
