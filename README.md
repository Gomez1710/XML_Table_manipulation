# XML table Manipulation

The following example comes from one of my tasks as a program analyst at PHC. The following data labeled **"finance_table.csv"** is financial data from our awardees that
comes from the reporting process. The data is pulled from our grant management system. However, the data is stored in a dynamic table and when pulled it shows as a
XML type data within the csv file. This folder showers my progress as I use different techniques to clean and extract values from an XML table.

- The new folder labled **"financial_report_cleaning_V2"** is my newest draft of working with and cleaning XML data. In this new version, I used the map function from the purrr library as well as several XML functions form the xml2 library. In this version, I no longer need to do text cleaning. This new version is cleaner and easier to read and follow.
